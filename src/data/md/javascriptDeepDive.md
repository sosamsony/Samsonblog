# JavaScript Deep Dive: How It Works Under the Hood

When you understand the runtime, you write better code—and debug faster.

## Execution context
- scope chain
- `this` binding
- hoisting (what it really means)

## Event loop
- call stack
- task queue
- microtask queue

## Closures
Why closures matter:
- callbacks
- hooks
- memoization

## Memory management
- garbage collection basics
- common memory leaks in UI apps

## Final thoughts
The best JS developers can explain behavior, not just write syntax.
