# Understanding the Jamstack Architecture

Jamstack is an approach: pre-render what you can, call APIs for what you must.

## Key ideas
- pre-built pages
- CDN delivery
- decoupled content (headless CMS)

## When Jamstack is ideal
- blogs and documentation
- marketing pages
- content-heavy websites

## When it’s not
- highly personalized pages
- real-time dashboards without caching strategy

## Final thoughts
Jamstack is about performance and simplicity—when used with intention.
