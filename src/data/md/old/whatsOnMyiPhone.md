Apple has released many iPhones. Yes, some — like the iPhone X and later — are more distinctive than others, but it’s not always obvious whether you have an iPhone 7 or an iPhone 6.

## Special Iphone

This is especially true if you didn’t happen to buy your iPhone yourself.

> This can be a problem if you want to sell your iPhone or if you want to know whether an app or iOS update will be compatible with it. Still, identifying your iPhone model is pretty simple.

In the case of recent models, you can simply dip into the settings and check which iPhone you have. In the case of earlier models, you can check the model number on the back of your phone, as well as our list below of iPhone models and their respective model numbers.

The About page gives you general info about your iPhone. It details the version of iOS you’re running, the storage capacity, and the model number. Also, if your iPhone is running iOS 12.2 or later, you can see your iPhone’s model name. This means that if you have an iPhone 5S or later, you should be able to see the model name without having to check anywhere else.

On the About screen, select the number on the right of the Model Number. That number typically starts with an M or N. After you choose it, you’ll see a number beginning with A. It’s that second number, the one beginning with an A, that is your iPhone’s model number. The model number can help symbolize which generation iPhone you own. Check over the list below to match your number to a corresponding iPhone iteration. 

One of the most direct ways to find your phone’s model number is to flip your phone around and check out the model number etched on the back. As we previously mentioned, A is the first character on all model numbers. It could help to compare the model number to the model number shown in the software settings to ensure the two match up— especially before you try selling your phone.
