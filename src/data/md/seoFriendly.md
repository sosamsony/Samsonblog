## The role of content in SEO

As you know, content plays a vital role in an SEO strategy. The web designer should have an in-depth knowledge of the kind of information, products, or services that your website intends to promote or sell. It is recommended that you keep a list of keywords ready at the initial stage. Focus on those keywords that your users are most likely to search for when searching for information related to your site.

When you are designing the web pages, you can start including the relevant keywords to save time that will be otherwise invested in optimizing the content for SEO purposes later.

The best thing about optimizing your site’s SEO while designing it is that the results will start showing up sooner, bringing more users to your site.
