# Getting Started with React (Updated 2023 Guide)

React is a UI library centered around composable components.

## Concepts to learn first
- components and props
- state and events
- conditional rendering
- lists and keys

## Project structure tips

- keep shared UI components separate
- isolate API logic

## Final thoughts
Build small things fast. Improve structure as the app grows.
