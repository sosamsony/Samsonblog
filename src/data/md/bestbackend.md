The part of the website that the user can interact with is called the front end or client side of the website. Every website needs a backend or server side to store and manage its internal data. So, is React.js frontend or backend?

React.js is a frontend library that is used with a backend. The end user of the website does not have direct access to the backend. But which backend for React should you choose? There are a lot of backend options available in the market. How would you know if your chosen backend is the right one?

In this article, you will learn how to choose the best backend for React websites in the easiest and cheapest way. Let us dive in! Do you want the best way to build amazing React apps? [Reach out to Sosamson](https://sosamson.com/)

## What is React?

React is one of the most popular front-end JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. It was developed and used by Facebook developers to implement functionalities such as news feeds. In 2013, the company decided to make React open-source so that everyone could utilize the power of React. React can also be rendered on the server using Node.js and can run mobile apps using React Native.

React is a client-side library that utilizes a one-page user interface. It makes it painless to create interactive UIs by designing a simple view for each state of your application. React efficiently updates and renders the appropriate components as your data changes, making your code more predictable and easier to debug with declarative views.

However, React is primarily a frontend technology, and to fully realize its potential, you need to pair it with a backend. The backend handles data storage, user authentication, business logic, and other server-side functionalities that the front-end interacts with.

## What Is the Need for the Best Backend for React Applications?

Backend development contains behind-the-scenes activities that occur during user interaction. It focuses on the server-side of the website (databases, scripting, website architecture). The backend developers write programs that communicate the database information to the browser. For example, You go on Amazon and search for a new shirt.

A Back End dev uses server-side language to pull all the information about shirts from a database. This information is processed in an application and returned to the user through the Front End language.

In every [React project](https://sosamson.com/), we manage data on the client through state and user interactions. However, many apps require data that comes from a database. The backend is responsible for getting and updating data behind the scenes. Let’s see some major use cases where the best backend for React is required:

- For server-side rendering, to prevent the crawling of the search engine.
- When your app requires open socket communication to support real-time events.
- When you need a database that meets the exact needs of your requirements and services.

There are several reasons why you need the best backend for React applications. Creating an IT solution for business is a complex process and choosing the right tech stack is crucial for assuring the success of your IT undertaking. As there are many options, you should carefully consider your needs and expectations and define your project requirements.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**1. Which backend is best for React.js?**
Each framework offers unique and useful features. To select the right backend, first, prioritize your requirements and then choose accordingly. We recommend using Express Js with NodeJS as they have proven to be the best and most appropriate backend framework for React. Although, it varies from user to user.

**2. Does React need a backend?**
All React projects manage data on clients through state-user interactions. However, many apps require data that comes from a database.

**3. Can we do backend with React?**
No. React is a front-end JavaScript library. React is capable of making API calls (sending the request to the backend), which deal with the data. React cannot process the database or the data source itself.
