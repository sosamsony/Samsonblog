What is the most essential factor that can effectively enhance the developer’s experience? Of course, selecting the right library or framework for the project is the ultimate parameter. And if we talk about the developer experience, we simply redirect to the factors that easily emphasize the developer’s convenience.

The primary focus of the developers is to make a selection of easy-to-use and convenient frameworks. So, it becomes essential to search for the best and leading framework to make web app development easy.

Many developers or individuals struggle to figure out the difference between Next JS vs React. They generally find a lot of confusion while choosing the right technology stack for their project. Therefore, on a regular basis, we come up with comparison information on NextJS Vs React and review them in detail from time to time in our blog posts.

## What is Next JS?

Before we start to understand the basic difference between React Vs NextJS, we need to get through the basic definition of NextJS and React. Next JS is an open-source JavaScript framework that allows you to quickly build a fast and user-friendly web application development for your business needs. Moreover, it is also responsible for developing static websites using React. Vercel is the creator of Next JS.

Typically based on Node.js and Babel, Next JS easily integrates with React to design and build robust Single Page Applications. This makes the server-side convenient and more for your web development needs. Many developers working with the best ReactJS development company typically use Next JS for building static websites.

With its active support of React Babel and Webpack, Next JS usually provides a feature-packed solution for server-side rendering (SSR) of React components. Next.js is an open-source JavaScript framework that allows developers to create dynamic and static web applications and websites using robust reusable components.

Furthermore, Next.js provides many features, such as static export, preview mode, pre-rendering, faster compilation, virtual DOM, and automatic building size optimization. In my view, the existing Next.js version is something React has been missing for quite a long time and it plays an essential role in designing and building complex web apps for your business needs.
