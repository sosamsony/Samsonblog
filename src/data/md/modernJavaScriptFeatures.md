# Modern JavaScript Features Every Developer Should Know

Modern JavaScript is about clarity and correctness.

## Features worth adopting
- top-level await (where supported)
- private class fields
- `Object.hasOwn`
- better error causes (`new Error("msg", { cause })`)
- improved regex support
- array helpers and ergonomic improvements

## Best practices in modern codebases
- prefer async/await over nested promises
- enforce formatting and lint rules
- use TypeScript for large apps

## Final thoughts
Adopt features that improve readability and reduce bugs—not trends.
