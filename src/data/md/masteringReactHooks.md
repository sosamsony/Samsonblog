# Mastering React Hooks

Hooks are best when you treat them as composable building blocks.

## Core hooks (practically)
- `useState` for local state
- `useEffect` for side-effects (carefully)
- `useMemo` and `useCallback` for stability

## Custom hooks
- keep them focused
- avoid hidden side effects
- expose a clean API

## Common mistakes
- missing dependency arrays
- mixing derived values into state
- putting too much logic in components

## Final thoughts
Hooks are powerful—but discipline makes them scalable.
