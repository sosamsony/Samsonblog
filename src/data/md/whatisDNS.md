# What is DNS and Its Role On A Website ðŸš€

There are a lot of acronyms and jargon in the web development industry. This post looks at what a DNS is, and why itâ€™s important for fast and secure websites.

The first thing when migrating a website or pushing a new one live involves directing your domain name to your host server. The direction is managed by a DNS resolver. Most domain name registrars include this service as part of the domain registration.

However, propagation times (the time waiting to visually see updates) can be slow and in some cases, you can be left waiting up to 72 hours to see your changes take effect.

A premium DNS provider is a dedicated service for making faster and more secure updates. If youâ€™re pushing important updates and want faster propagation times, investing in a premium DNS provider can be the answer.

## Are The DNS And The Domain Name The Same Thing?

Lots of people ask this question, The confusion is understandable as the DNS is closely related to the domain name. DNS even stands for [Domain Name System.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) They are NOT the same thing though.
A domain name is a human-friendly address identifier given to a website, for example, [sosamson.com.](http://sosamson.com/) But networks and connected devices use numerical addresses to locate and connect with each other. These numerical IP addresses donâ€™t trip quite so easily off the tongue for us organic lifeforms.
A DNS on the other hand relates to a server or service that controls where to point a user once they hit the domain name. It associates and translates the domain name to its numerical IP address, enabling it to be found and connected to, wherever it lives on the web.
A DNS has various records associated with it, the most popular being A records and MX records.
An A record connects to a web server, allowing website visitors to begin viewing content, whereas an MX record connects to an email server, to send and receive email using a domain name.

## A Phone Book Of The Web

A DNS or Domain Name System is like a phone book of the web. It stores records and connects domain names like www.sosamson.com to IP addresses to make it easier for users to connect to websites or services. Similar to a number plate on a car. A plate is easier to remember than a carâ€™s VIN number. Domains are easier to remember than IP Addresses.

## DNS Record Types

#### DNS records are entries in the DNS system that provide information about domain names, their associated IP addresses, and other domain-related data. Several DNS record types exist, each serving a specific function. Some of the most common DNS record types are:

- **A (Address) Record:** An A record maps a domain name to an IPv4 address. It is the most common record type and essential for resolving a domain name to an IP address.
- **AAAA (IPv6 Address) Record:** Similar to an A record, an AAAA record maps a domain name to an IPv6 address. With the increasing adoption of IPv6, AAAA records are becoming more prevalent.
- **CNAME (Canonical Name) Record:** A CNAME record maps an alias domain name to a canonical (true) domain name. This allows a domain to point to another domain, simplifying DNS management and enabling multiple domain names to reference the same IP address without duplicating records. Note that a CNAME record cannot coexist with other record types for the same subdomain.
- **MX (Mail Exchange) Record:** An MX record is used to specify the mail servers responsible for handling email for a domain. It defines the priority and order in which mail servers should be used, enabling email delivery and facilitating load balancing and redundancy.
- **NS (Name Server) Record:** An NS record specifies the authoritative name servers for a domain. It is crucial for delegating DNS responsibilities to other servers and ensuring proper DNS resolution and management.
- **TXT (Text) Record:** A TXT record is a general-purpose record that stores arbitrary text information related to a domain. It is commonly used for various purposes, such as email security (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), domain ownership verification, and other third-party services.

## DNS Management for Web Developers

As a web developer, managing DNS correctly for your web applications is essential to ensure optimal performance, security, and reliability. Domain providers typically offer an interface that allows you to manage your domain's DNS records. Here are some steps to help you effectively manage your DNS records:

1. Understand your domain registrar's control panel: Get acquainted with the interface and options your domain registrar provides for managing your DNS records. Your domain provider's interface should offer DNS management functionality like adding, editing, or deleting records.
2. Verify your name server delegation: Ensure your domain is correctly delegated to the required name servers. Name server delegation is crucial as it tells the DNS system which servers are responsible for handling DNS queries for your domain.
3. Create the necessary DNS records: Depending upon the requirements of your web application, create the appropriate DNS records like A, AAAA, CNAME, and MX. Remember to test any newly created or modified DNS records>.
4. Verify DNS propagation: After making changes to your DNS, note that it may take some time before the changes are propagated worldwide. You can use online tools like DNS propagation checkers to monitor the status of your DNS updates.
5. Use subdomains and descriptive names: Organize your records using subdomains and descriptive names to make management and troubleshooting easier in the long run. This approach can provide better clarity when dealing with multiple records and environments.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: What is DNS, and why is it important for web developers? A1:** DNS stands for Domain Name System. It translates human-readable domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network. For web developers, managing DNS is crucial because it ensures that users can access websites reliably, efficiently, and securely.

**Q2: How do I access DNS management for my domain? A2:** DNS management is typically available through your domain registrar's control panel. You need to log in to your account with the registrar where your domain is registered, and navigate to the DNS or domain management section to access your DNS settings.

**Q3: What are the common types of DNS records, and when should I use them? A3:** Common DNS records include:

- A Record: Points a domain to an IPv4 address. Use it when you want to link your domain or subdomain to a specific IP address.
- AAAA Record: Points a domain to an IPv6 address. Use it similarly to an A record, but for IPv6 addresses.
- CNAME Record: Maps a domain name to another domain name. Use it for aliasing one domain to another (e.g., www.sosamson.com to sosamson.com).
- MX Record: Specifies the mail server responsible for receiving email for the domain. Use it to configure email services for your domain.

**Q4: What is name server delegation, and why is it important? A4:** Name server delegation involves assigning your domain to specific name servers that are responsible for handling DNS queries for your domain. Itâ€™s important because without proper delegation, your domain won't resolve correctly, making your website inaccessible.

**Q5: How long does DNS propagation take after making changes? A5:** DNS propagation can take anywhere from a few minutes to 48 hours or more, depending on various factors such as TTL (Time to Live) settings and the DNS caching mechanisms of ISPs around the world.

**Q6: What are subdomains, and how should I use them in DNS management? A6:** Subdomains are extensions of your main domain (e.g., blog.example.com). They are useful for organizing different sections or services of your website. In DNS management, use subdomains to separate content, applications, or environments, which can simplify management and troubleshooting.

**Q7: How can I check if my DNS changes have propagated? A7:** You can use online tools like DNS propagation checkers or command-line tools like dig or nslookup to monitor the status of your DNS changes. These tools can show you how your DNS records are being resolved across different regions.

**Q8: Can incorrect DNS settings affect my website's performance? A8:** Yes, incorrect DNS settings can lead to website downtime, slow loading times, email delivery issues, and potential security vulnerabilities. It's crucial to double-check your DNS settings to ensure everything is configured correctly.
